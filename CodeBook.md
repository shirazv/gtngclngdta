<b>Data Set Information </b>
<br>
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial 
angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset 
has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 


<b>Transformation Details</b>
<br>
<br>1. Merges the training and test sets to create single data set.
<br>2. Extracts only measurements on  mean and standard deviation.
<br>3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
<br>4. Labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
<br>5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

<b>Requirments for run_analysis.R</b>
<br>
- Requires Reshape2 and data.tables libraries
- Requires availability of test and train data sets in working directory
- Exports tidy_data.txt
