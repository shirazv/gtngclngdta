Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4

<b>Purpose</b><br>
Demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 
<br>1) a tidy data set as described below, 
<br>2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
<br>3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 

<br>This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
<br>
<b>Dependencies</b>
run_analysis.R depends on the reshape2 and data.table packages.
